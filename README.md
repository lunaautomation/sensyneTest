# Sensyne Test
## Pre-requisites
The latest version of Node should be installed, for more info see https://nodejs.org/en/

## Installation instructions
Clone the repository and run the following on the command prompt in the cloned dir:
>`npm install`

Once NPM has installed all packages you can run the tests by typing:
>`npm test`

This will run the tests on the command line.

Alternatively if you would prefer to use the GUI, run the following command:
>`npx cypress open`

Once Cypress has finished installing you should see the test `Product_spec.js` listed in the GUI.
